# CNN Image Classifier

This repository hosts a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classifier built using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to classify images into specific categories after being trained on a labeled dataset.

## Overview

The CNN architecture used here leverages deep learning to effectively learn and classify images. The model's training and evaluation pipelines are included, allowing users to train the model on custom datasets or fine-tune existing models for specific image classification tasks.

## Features

- **CNN Architecture**: Utilizes a custom CNN architecture optimized for image classification tasks.
- **Training Scripts**: Includes scripts to train the model on provided datasets or custom datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluation scripts for assessing the model's performance on test datasets.
- **Pre-processing**: Covers pre-processing steps for preparing input data for the CNN model.

## Usage

### Installation

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-image-classifier.git
cd cnn-image-classifier
```

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or other compatible deep learning framework)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- (Add any other specific requirements)

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training

1. Prepare your dataset or use the provided dataset.
2. Adjust configurations in the training script if necessary.
3. Start the training process:

```bash
python train.py
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

### Customization

You can customize the model architecture, training parameters, and dataset to suit your specific image classification task.
